It's using [MarkedJS](https://marked.js.org/) so that you have everything [Github Flavored Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) offers and styled with [TailwindCSS ](https://tailwindcss.com/) to match [Dev.to](https://dev.to/) and [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/) dark theme. The toolbar has the most common markdown syntax including tables, code blocks and many more. </br>
